# GitHub Issue Explorer

This project is a GitHub Issue Explorer web application built with React, TypeScript, Redux,Redux-Observable and GraphQL. The app allows users to input a GitHub API token, browse all public repositories, view repository details and explore issues with pagination support.

# Screens

Token Input Page: Allows the user to input and validate a GitHub API token.
Repositories Page: Displays a list of public repositories.
Repository Details Page: Shows detailed information for a specific repository, including a list of issues.

# Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
TypeScript: Static typing for JavaScript.
Redux Toolkit: Simplified state management with Redux.
Redux-Observable: For managing side effects using reactive programming with RxJS.
GraphQL: For querying GitHub's API.
React Router: For handling client-side routing.
CSS/Bootstrap: For styling the components.

# Installation

1.Clone the repository
cd github-explorer
2.npm install
3.npm start
4.Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the app.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
